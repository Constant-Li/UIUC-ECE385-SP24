## 🚀 How to Run
If you prefer not to rebuild the entire project in Vivado, you can use the pre-built `mb_usb_hdmi_top.xsa` file:

1. Launch **Xilinx Vitis** and create a new project.  
2. Open the `/gomoku/workspace` directory inside the project.  
3. Import the `mb_usb_hdmi_top.xsa` file as your **Hardware Specification**.  
4. **Build** and **Run** the program.
