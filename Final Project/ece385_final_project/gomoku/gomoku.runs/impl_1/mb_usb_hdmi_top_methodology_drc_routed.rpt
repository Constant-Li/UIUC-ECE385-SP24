TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock mb_block/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and clk_out2_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mb_block/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mb_block/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP mb_block/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/frame/color_instance/read_addr0 input pin mb_block/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/frame/color_instance/read_addr0/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#2 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP mb_block/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/frame/color_instance/read_addr_press0 input pin mb_block/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/frame/color_instance/read_addr_press0/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#3 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP mb_block/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/frame/color_menu/read_addr0 input pin mb_block/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/frame/color_menu/read_addr0/C[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
